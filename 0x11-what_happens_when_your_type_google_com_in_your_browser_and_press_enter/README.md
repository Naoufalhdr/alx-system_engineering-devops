## Introduction
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack. This project aims to explore the infrastructure side (network, servers, security, etc.) and provide a clear understanding of how a software system works when a user accesses a website.

## Tasks

### 0. What happens when...
This task involves writing a detailed blog post explaining what happens when you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter. The post covers:
- DNS request
- TCP/IP
- Firewall
- HTTPS/SSL
- Load-balancer
- Web server
- Application server
- Database

### 1. Everything's better with a pretty diagram
This task requires creating a visual diagram that illustrates the flow of the request created when you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter. The diagram includes:
- DNS resolution
- The request hitting the server IP on the appropriate port
- Encrypted traffic
- Traffic passing through a firewall
- Request distribution via a load balancer
- Web server serving a web page
- Application server generating the web page
- Application server requesting data from the database
